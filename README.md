There are four crystals below. By the clikcing on a crystal you will add a specific amount to your
                    total
                    score.
                    You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the game if your total
                    score
                    goes above the random number.

  The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
 Each time when the game starts, the game will change the value of each crystal.
